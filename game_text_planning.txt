Title: Broke

I'm a broke octopus.
I used to live in the depth of the ocean with my girlfriend...
Until I proposed to her...

"Will you marry me?"
She was speechless as I put the algae ring on her tentacle.
"YES!!!!!!!"

I thought that was it. But one day, she was gone.
Left me a note that goes as below:

"I need you to collect something for me.
"I'm not an ordinary octopus.
"OCEAN STARDUST, CONSCIENCE OF COAL, SEALED NARCISSUS, and HYDROSOI
"These I will need to maintain the normal look of an octopus.
"Sorry I've been lying to you all this time.
"Will you do this for me?"

I'm a BROKE octopus with none of the treasures she mentioned.
I paid visits to the sages. I inquired the sperm whale clairvoyant.
They all point me towards one answer...

Humans.

Checkpoint 1: octopus slides through the slit on the wall and the tank
lid gets removed from the tank. Shark starts to chase after octopus.

Checkpoint 2: octopus enters restaurant area. Instruction text "Go straight for the window!"
When colliding with ingredients for the first time,
pause game and explain the what the ingredient is.

Checkpoint 3: octopus finds window locked. Instruction text "Go for the door!"

Checkpoint 4: octopus finds the door locked and needs a passcode for the door's pad.
Instruction text "Check if it's somewhere near the cashier."

Checkpoint 5: passcode retrieved. But shark blocks the original way. Instruction text "Try the bar table!"

Checkpoint 6: jump off the bar table and slide under the door (supposed to be sarcastic here. "Why the shit didn't I try that first?")
